The central theme of this paper is to bring retrieval models and approximate string similarity algorithms together.
We proposed a sequential splitting variants like BREAK-1, 2, Off, n.
To relate these sequential splits, we proposed MAKE algorithm, which constructs the probabilistic distribution between the query and document split sets. 
Finally we designed the TAKE curve, to fit these heuristics in the normalization function of the ranking functions.
In the experiments, we saw that our heuristics were robust against the datasets characteristics like mislabeling, low training dataset size and scales well in larger datasets.
We plan to improve BREAK-n and apply SNP detection problem to real datasets and complex bioinformatics applications in the future.
